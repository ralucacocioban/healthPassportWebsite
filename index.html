					<h2>We are changing the way <strong>people with learning disabilities and dementia</strong> access technology</h2>
					<p>Our target group of users usually experience difficulties in: reading, taking care of themselves, understanding new or complex information, learning new skills and coping independently with mentally intensive tasks. <br>For these reasons, Health Passport is designed to support them in their daily activities and bring technology closer to them. The functionalities that it offers allow patients to store their personal details, objects they like/dislike, their allergies, emotions and encourages the users to take pictures through which they can express themselves or the way they feel.</p>

									<header>
										<h3>Digitalized Healthcare data</h3>
									</header>
									<p>“HealthPassport” allows users to store their healthcare information such as allergies, level of understanding, type of communication prefered, number of support hours needed per day and other useful details. All this data is displayed on the website or within the “HealthPassport” app making all this information easily accessible and allowing patients to present their healthcare data without the need of carrying physical documents.</p>

								<section>
									<a href="#" class="image feature"><img src="images/pic3.png" alt="" /></a>
									<header>
										<h3>Option to take photos</h3>
									</header>
									<p>
										Users of this system will be able to take photos and capture important moments in their life. By taking advantage of this feature, they will be able to interact with the app more often and will have the chance to express themselves and store photos of people, objects or events that impressed them.</p>
									</section>

								<div class="6u">

									<section>
										<a href="#" class="image feature"><img src="images/pic2.png" alt="" /></a>
										<header>
											<h3>Customizable contact list</h3>
										</header>
										<p>“HealthPassport” allows its users to create their own list of important people in their life and customize this list by specifying the relationship with the person, providing a brief description etc.</p>
									</section>

								</div>
								<div class="6u">

									<section>
										<a href="#" class="image feature"><img src="images/pic4.png" alt="" /></a>
										<header>
											<h3>Likes and Dislikes questionnaire</h3>
										</header>
										<p>Users can easily express their preferences by liking or disliking various pictures. This data becomes very useful to NHS which uses a like/dislike technique in order to analyze and monitor the progress of their patients’ with learning disabilities and dementia.</p>
									</section>

								</div>

								<div class="6u">

									<section>
										<a href="#" class="image feature"><img src="images/pic5.png" alt="" /></a>
										<header>
											<h3>Mood Expression</h3>
										</header>
										<p>The “HealthPassport” product includes the possibility of expressing emotions such as happy, sad and in pain together with the chance to give reasons of what generated that specific mood. Our target audience will benefit from this since studies show that these people tend to be very introvert and can’t express their feelings publicly. </p>
									</section>

								</div>

								<div class="6u">

									<section>
										<a href="#" class="image feature"><img src="images/pic6.png" alt="" /></a>
										<header>
											<h3>Events and Notifications</h3>
										</header>
										<p>The system allows patients to add new events to the calendar specifying at the same time the type of event (birthday, appointment, medicine reminder). This functionality has a tremendous impact on people with learning disabilities and dementia since it uses a notification system to remind them about the upcoming events.</p>
									</section>

								</div>

								<div class="6u">

								<section>
									<a href="#" class="image feature"><img src="images/pic8.png" alt="" /></a>
									<header>
										<h3>Availability</h3>
									</header>
									<p>The system is designed to provide all the functionalities both online and offline. Whenever there is no connection to the Internet all the changes are stored locally and as soon as there is a contact with the network, any changes made to the local database are synchronised with the database stored on the server.</p>
									</section>

								</div>

								<div class="6u">

								<section>
									<a href="#" class="image feature"><img src="images/pic7.png" alt="" /></a>
									<header>
										<h3>Extensibility</h3>
									</header>
									<p>The system supports loose coupling and therefore it has potential to allow and accept extension of capabilities. Every single feature of the application can be easily reused without the need of rewriting the existing code. There is also an extensive system and user manual, which explains how to operate with the current API and lets developers take advantage of all the functionalities that we have implemented.</p>
									</section>

								</div>

								<div class="6u">

								<section>
									<a href="#" class="image feature"><img src="images/pic9.png" alt="" /></a>
									<header>
										<h3>Cloud for pictures, events and contacts</h3>
									</header>
									<p>Our system allows patients to store their pictures, events and contacts on the cloud. In this way, their data will always be securely saved and will be available to their doctors and relatives as well. Patients also have the opportunity to update or delete their information online so that they can keep their details up-to-date and can take advantage of synchronizing it with all their devices.</p>
									</section>

								</div>

								<div class="6u">

								<section>
									<a href="#" class="image feature"><img src="images/pic10.png" alt="" /></a>
									<header>
										<h3>Encrypted passwords over https</h3>
									</header>
									<p>The system is protected by an authorization system. We encrypt passwords and send them using https requests; therefore, we never store plain passwords.
The system is not open to any of the security threats, such as SQL injection attack. 
The system supports Role-based access control (RBAC) model , which restricts system access to authorized users only.</p>
